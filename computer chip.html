		<p style="text-align: center; font-size:17; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px"> Research team leader Dr Sumeet Walia said the technology moves us closer towards artificial intelligence (AI) that can harness the brain's full sophisticated functionality.
																				The researchers, from the Functional Materials and Microsystems Research Group at RMIT, have also demonstrated the chip can perform logic operations -- information processing -- ticking another box for brain-like functionality.

What we have done is learn from the brain's anatomy and physiology," said study leader Dharmendra Modha, manager and lead researcher of the cognitive computing groupat IBM Research - Almaden in San Jose, California.
																									  Modha gave an analogy to explain how the brainlike chip differs from a classical computer chip. You can think of a classical computer as a left-brained machine, he told Live Science; it's fast, sequential and good at crunching numbers. "What we're building is the counterpart, right-brain machine," he said.
